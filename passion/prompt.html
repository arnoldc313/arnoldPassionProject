                I was first introduced to video games at a very young age, I would guess around 4 years old. My first video game console was a Nintendo Wii that my parents bought. They were a major influence on my passion for video games.  My dad would also buy me whichever game or console, which in my eyes encouraged my passion for it. However, they hate it when they see me playing video games which I find very ironic. My older sister was also into video games, which also inspired me to play them since I was addicted to beating her in any game. Ever since then It has always been addictive to just play a specific game for hours, my first being Mario Kart, and later expanding to more complex types of games.

                Around this time, I noticed my cousins were also passionate about video games as well. Although the games they played were too mature for my age, such as games that involve guns and gore, It still inspired me to play them when I got older. Today, a lot of the gaming community inspires me to continue playing as much as I do. I really like seeing what everyone is playing and keeping up to date with new games as well. My friends at school and online inspire me to play as well since we enjoy playing online multiplayer games together. We have fun playing small games and also compete in larger more competitive ones too. I’ve even tried making my own games on websites like Roblox, but they weren’t successful and didn’t function properly.
